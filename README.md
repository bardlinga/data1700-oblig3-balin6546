<h2>Description:</h2>
This is a small spring boot web app that simulates a movie ticket ordering system using a h2
in-memory database to store and handle the tickets. Frontend is HTML, JS and CSS and the 
application communicates with the backend through Java using JDBC.

<h2>Features:</h2>
- Real-time input validation with error messages upon changing inputs or trying to create a
new ticket.<br>
- A button to autofill the whole form with dummy info for testing purposes.<br>
- Edit and delete buttons for individual tickets in the ticket list. The edit button sends
all of the ticket info to the form, disables the buy button and creates two new buttons to
save or cancel changes. Buttons are reset upon saving changes or cancelling.<br>
- Delete button that removes all tickets.<br>
- Ticket and movie lists are stored in the database, and all changes, edits and deletes are
done in backend before the frontend is updated.<br>
